To prepare, please install the the following on your machine:\n\n- Install latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), v2022.07.0-548 or later\n- Install latest version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (v1.0.36 or greater)\n- After installing Quarto, open the terminal in RStudio and:\n  - See [this guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal-in-the-RStudio-IDE) for details on using the terminal\n  - Install/Update TinyTeX for PDFs with `quarto install tool tinytex`\n  - Install/Update Chromium with `quarto install tool chromium`\n- Ideally upgrade/use to R 4.1 or R 4.2\n- Install these R packages:\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.r .cell-code}\n  pkg_list <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"quarto\", \"rmarkdown\", \"palmerpenguins\")\n  install.packages(pkg_list)\n  ```\n  :::\n\n\n### Teaching Team\n\n#### Andrew Bray\n\nAndrew Bray is a statistician at UC Berkeley where he develops and teaches courses in statistics and data science. His research interests include statistical computing, data privacy, and applications of statistical models to environmental science. He was previously an Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics at Reed College and an NSF Five Colleges postdoctoral fellow in western Massachusetts.\n\n#### Rebecca Barter\n\nRebecca is a statistician, data scientist, educator, and communicator who has a dual passion for empowering others by teaching critical thinking and technical skills for data science, and for uncovering the hidden patterns and stories that live inside complex datasets (primarily related to healthcare and medicine). She is currently a postdoc at UC Berkeley and she sometimes writes about data science and R on her website at <www.rebeccabarter.com>.\n\n#### Silvia Canel√≥n\n\nSilvia (she/her) is a researcher, community organizer, and R educator. Her research projects at the University of Pennsylvania leverage electronic health record data to study pregnancy-related outcomes, and her organizing values data literacy as a way to build power and effect change.\n\nShe enjoys finding ways to communicate technical knowledge with a variety of audiences and loves learning how modern tools in the R ecosystem can support reproducible, efficient, and accessible workflows.\n\nYou can find out what Silvia is up to lately at <silviacanelon.com>.\n\n#### Christophe Dervieu\n\n#### Tatsu\n\n### Configuration\n\nEach session will feature exercises where you'll be authoring documents in Quarto.
