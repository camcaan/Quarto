## Overview

This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills and expertise and apply them in Quarto, the next generation of R Markdown. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that offers multilingual programming language support to create dynamic and static documents, books, presentations, blogs, and other online resources. In this workshop you will learn how to apply your reproducible authoring skills to the Quarto format and learn about new tools and workflows for authoring with Quarto in RStudio. You will learn to create static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and htmlwidgets, and to create presentations in various formats such as reveal.js, beamer, and pptx. The workshop will also introduce you to Quarto projects which you can use to build websites and write blogs and books. Finally, you will learn various ways to deploy and publish your Quarto projects on the web. Independent modules will also highlight authoring in Quarto with Jupyter and VS Code as well as other text editors.

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to any of these questions:

Have you authored R Markdown documents and are you interested in migrating your workflow to its successor format, Quarto?

Are you interested in exploring the wide spectrum of documents that can be produced with Quarto, including static documents, websites, and slides?
